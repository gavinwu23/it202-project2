-right now it can only do basic query. it cannot handle multiple days...

-for day of movie, i made a textbox and valid inputs are
	-Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun

	- maybe change this to checkbox to make it easier

TODO:
	work on top things..


specs of this app:

	if you click search without typing anything in the whole box, then it will search the entire database.

	after clicking search -> it goes to a table of movies found
	then you can click on map to display the clickable markers along with map

	Once you go back to search tab, everything automatically resets.

	upcoming movies might be whack for now, but will revise later, but it works for now.
